## üß≠ About Me

I am a CEH (Practical) certified cybersecurity enthusiast with strong hands-on experience in **threat detection**, **SIEM automation**, and **adversarial simulation**. My expertise lies in building AI-powered tools for phishing analysis, log decoding, malware investigation, and SOC workflows. I enjoy working at the intersection of **Red Team simulation**, **Threat Intelligence**, and **Security Operations (SOC)**.

I also actively participate in **CTF platforms** like OverTheWire, HackTheBox, and TryHackMe to sharpen my offensive security skills.
